# SE-COMPONENTS---ACTIVITIES-

Activity 1: Singleton Pattern - Logger Utility
Objective
To understand the Singleton pattern by creating a simple logging utility that ensures only one instance of the logger is used throughout the application.

Instructions
1. Create a Logger class that will log messages with timestamps.
2. Use the Singleton pattern to ensure there is only one Logger instance.
3. Create two variables that attempt to access the Logger instance, and confirm they reference the same instance.

Activity 2: Prototype Pattern - Cloning a Shape
Objective
To understand the Prototype pattern by creating a system for cloning shapes with different properties.

Instructions
1. Create an interface ShapePrototype with a clone method.
2. Implement two classes, Circle and Rectangle, that inherit from ShapePrototype.
3. The clone method should create a new instance of the shape with the same properties.
4. Test cloning a shape and modifying the properties of the cloned instance to see if the original shape remains unchanged.
